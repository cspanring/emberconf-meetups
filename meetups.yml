      Forge Parkour is a great parkour gym a few of us jumped around at last year. There is an Intro to Parkour class and a Parkour 1 & 2 class at 7 on Thursday. Ping me on Discord if you're interested and I'll coordinate with the gym. You'll need sneakers and clothes you can move in. No prior experience necessary. $15-$25.
